# Cpp Question 1
Your goal for this challenge is to modify Shop.h to make sure this test passes all the time and explain why it might pass sometimes.

This test simulate the case where you have a thread that is generating data and another thread 
that is consuming this data. We need to make sure there is no memory corruption.
By the way, if the test doesn't run (ends without the green/red) it means there was a memory access violation.
