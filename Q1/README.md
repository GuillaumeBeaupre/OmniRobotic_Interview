# Question 1
So here we are! \
Your goal for this first challenge is to implement an algorithm that will simplify a list of points that represents a polyline.

The goal is to remove as much points as possible according to our distance threshold and reduce the number of segments of the polyline and still keep our polyline toplogy.  We use those kind of algorithm to manage the LOD(level of detail) and also remove noise generated by our 3D Scanners.

## Inputs:
- double MaxToleratedDeviation

## Outputs:
- List\<Vect3> simplifiedPolyline

Q1.csproj is a C# class library project in which you need to add your implementation.\
Q1Functions.cs file contains the prototype of the function in which you need to add your implementation.
